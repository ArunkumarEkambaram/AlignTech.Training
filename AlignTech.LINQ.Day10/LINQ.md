**LINQ**

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a Microsoft .NET feature for querying data in C# or VB.NET. It provides a uniform syntax to query collections, databases, XML, and other data sources. Using methods like Where, Select, or OrderBy, it enables filtering, transforming, and sorting data in a concise, readable way. LINQ queries can be written as query expressions or method chains, integrating directly with code, and support deferred execution for efficiency.



Common LINQ methods:



Where: Filters elements based on a condition.

Select: Projects each element into a new form.

OrderBy: Sorts elements in ascending order.

OrderByDescending: Sorts elements in descending order.

First: Returns the first element matching a condition.

Last: Returns the last element matching a condition.

Single: Returns the only element matching a condition.

Count: Counts elements matching a condition.

Any: Checks if any element satisfies a condition.

All: Checks if all elements satisfy a condition.

GroupBy: Groups elements by a key.

Join: Joins two sequences based on a key.

Take: Takes a specified number of elements.

Skip: Skips a specified number of elements.

Distinct: Returns unique elements.
