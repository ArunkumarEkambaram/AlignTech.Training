C# Fundamentals

* What is C#? C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's a general-purpose, high-level language that's part of the .NET ecosystem. It's used to develop a variety of applications including web, desktop, mobile, and games (especially with the Unity engine).

Key Features:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C# leverages classes and objects for code structure and reusability. It supports OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Platform Independence: With .NET Core (now unified under ".NET"), C# applications can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Strongly Typed: C# requires variables and expressions to have predefined data types, helping to prevent errors.
* Automatic Memory Management: C# employs garbage collection to handle memory management.

Built-in types in C#

1\. Boolean type – Only true or false 

2\. Integral Types - sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char

3\. Floating Types – float and double

4\. Decimal Types 

5\. String Type 



1\. Implicit conversions

2\. Explicit Conversions

3\. Difference between Parse() and TryParse()



Implicit conversion is done by the compiler:

1\. When there is no loss of information if the conversion is done

2\. If there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion

Example: Converting an int to a float will not loose any data and no exception will be thrown, Where as when converting a float to an int, we loose the fractional part and also a possibility of overflow exception. Hence, in this case an explicit conversion is required.
